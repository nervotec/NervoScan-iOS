## üîë Licensing

The NervoScan SDK requires a valid license key. To obtain one, contact us at **sales@nervoscan.com**.

### Adding the License Key

Initialize the SDK with your license key:

```swift
let nervoScanSdk = NervoScanSdk(licenseKey: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY")
```

---

## üìñ Usage

### 1. Initialize and Configure the SDK

Ensure your app requests camera access by updating the `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access for health monitoring.</string>
```

### 2. Using the SDK

#### Set Up the ViewModel

The `CameraViewModel` manages the SDK‚Äôs functionality and camera session.

```swift
import SwiftUI

@StateObject private var viewModel = CameraViewModel()

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        if let session = viewModel.session {
            CameraPreview(session: session)
        }
        Button("Start Scan") {
            viewModel.startScan()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sample Integration

```swift
import SwiftUI
import NervoScanSDK

struct ScanView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = CameraViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if let session = viewModel.session {
                CameraPreview(session: session)
            } else {
                Text("Camera session not available.")
            }
            Button(viewModel.isScanning ? "Stop Scan" : "Start Scan") {
                if viewModel.isScanning {
                    viewModel.stopScan()
                } else {
                    viewModel.startScan()
                }
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            viewModel.startScan()
        }
        .onDisappear {
            viewModel.stopScan()
        }
    }
}
```
